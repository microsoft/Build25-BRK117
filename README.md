## Overview
**Develop AI models and intelligent applications without ever leaving VS Code.** During BRK117 you learned how to:
- üîç Prototype an AI Agent with MCP servers locally
- ‚úçÔ∏è Scale and Deploy AI Agents to Azure
- üõ†Ô∏è Do all of it in VS Code with AI Tools

Here we provide resources to try everything you saw in this Build session at home, as well as references to go deeper on each technology.
